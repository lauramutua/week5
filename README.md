# Biography Page

This a plain HTML page that shows the biography of Jane Doe. Currently, there are no CSS styles applied, and the page looks very plain! 

Your goal is to style the biography page. When you've finished with the styles, the page should look like this:

![biography](/images/biography.png)

# Instructions

- Make the level one heading pink, using the CSS color keyword `hotpink`.
- Give the heading a `10px dotted` border-bottom which uses the CSS color keyword `purple`.
- Make the level 2 heading italic.
- Give the ul used for the contact details a background-color of #eeeeee, and a 5px solid purple border.
- Use some `padding` and `margin` to push the content away from the border.
- Make the links green on hover

When you're finished with the styles, check your site against the image above, and click submit.
